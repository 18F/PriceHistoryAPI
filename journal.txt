Got up early and started working.  I think I have 
found a pretty elegant way to make make the OS2 data work
with the FedBid data.

TODO:

* My graph is not drawing in all cases, need to figure that out - x
* Need to construct the other fields from OS2 - partial
* Perhaps Dollars in field are messing it up. - yes
* Performance is getting to be a problem.  Need to consider:
1) leaving everything in memory
2) SOLR index is probably a valuable next step
3) Adding limitation 
* Need to add shared javascript/python simbol table.


* Need to Make graph bigger.
* Why is the legend table so awful?
* How can use color effectively?
* Need to create a "fielded" detail display which is 
better
* Need to investigate the PSC code, do all Office Supplies get one? - yes
* Need to investigate AwardID/IDV, is it the same as agency?

* Need to allow sorting of grid by columns
* Need to create create product description abbreviation
* Need to add Date as a standard field?
* Need to figure out AWS---not sure how that compares in 
importance.

Priorities:

* Make graph bigger x
* Make Legend better x 
* Remove to 20% x

5:10 Sunday night.

Data issues remain.  The fielded data is probably the biggest issue,
and then filling in the Commodity Type and Award ID/IDV field if I 
can.  But before I do that, I need to take a break and decide what 
else to do tonight.

Have just done a git init.  Will now test.
