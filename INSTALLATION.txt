STEPS TO CREATING A PRICESPAID AWS INSTANCE
(but applicable to any other deployment)



When you create the AWS, be sure the security group has port 22 (ssh) open.
The default apparently doesn't.

Make sure your public key is not publicly readable.

Ssh to the AWS instance.

Install emacs, of course, to help with everything else.  Some other editor 
might sort of work as well.
Install mod_wsgi with “yum install mod_wsgi”
Install mod_ssl with “yum install mod_ssl”
Install the software to /var/www/PricePaid
Install the virtual hosts sections to the httpd.conf file that you get 
from Robert L. Read or the project directory
Install easy_install with: wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | python 
Install bottle with easy_install
install pysolr https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysolr/3.1.0 with 
“sudo python setup.py install or drop the pysolr.py file anywhere on your PYTHONPATH.
Install solr-4.4 with scp copy of the tgz file --- 
don't know how to do it with yum.  I don't recommend that it 
go under /var/www/html

Untar it.

scp the schema.xml file up to it.

Start Jetty in the background redirecting to a log file.

Scp solrpy-0.9.5 to the box and exute “python setup.py install” in its directory.

Execute “python solrlodr.py” in the application directory.

Rewrite the directory in app.wsgi --- I really need to move this out!! That totally sucks!

Restart apache and test.

Note: I find it easier to do development and debugging work by running bottle directly against PricesPaidGUI, which by default puts it on Port 8080.  However, I run the service api with app_wsgi in apache, which does mean that you have to remember to do an Apache restart if you make a code change.
